# wage_difference_within_Seattle_gov_department

Motivation:
Work wage difference is a common perception within societies, as workloads and level of expertise differs from job to job. But how much wage difference is a good difference? Are all individuals getting paid fairly for the difficulty of their jobs, or are some getting underpaid?

Goal:
the project focuses on researching the wage differences within the Seattle government department.
Specifically, the project aims to find if an individual's working department has an effect on the amount of work wage earned,
and if the differing of work wage is unreasonably large. In any case, it may help recognizing a potential issue in the distribution of work wage among the Seattle government departments.

The project currently contains R code that analyze the dataset City_of_Seattle_Data.csv
The current csv version of the dataset being used has data up to 11/27/2025

I do not own the rights to any of the datasets used in this project; the dataset comes from the official Seattle government dataset website, with the wage dataset updated regularly.
